# bookbot

BookBot is my first [Boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev) project.

** How to use **
This bot is simple to use, all you need is to have python3 installed (anything on 3 will do) and a
command line interface to type from. Once you have these requirements, follow this format to use it:
"python3 main.py <filepath>"

Note: If you put in too many or too little arguments for the bot (it only takes 1 argument, the file path) it will remind you how to use it
